Respected [Authority's Title/Name],

I am writing to bring to your kind attention an issue I have encountered regarding the fee for my registration in the badminton sport by our sports club. The fee for the registration, as per the information provided, is ₹500. However, when I checked my ERP portal, it shows a fee due of ₹1000, which is double the actual amount.

I believe this discrepancy might have occurred due to an error, and I kindly request you to look into this matter and resolve it at the earliest possible convenience.

I would greatly appreciate it if the fee dues could be updated to reflect the correct amount of ₹500. Kindly let me know if you require any additional information or documents to facilitate this process.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Sridhar Sahu
