# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App

This project uses a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on selected features such as `LotArea`, `SaleCondition`, `SaleType`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`, and `GarageType`.  
It is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit** web application.

## 🔍 Overview

🎯 **Goal**: Predict house prices using user-provided inputs.  
🤖 **Model Used**: Linear Regression  
🌐 **Framework**: Streamlit – used to create an interactive and responsive web application  
🧠 **Backend/ML**: Python, Scikit-learn  
📊 **Dataset**: [Ames House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User provides house features via the web form.
2. Categorical variables are encoded using `encoder.pkl`.
3. The trained model (`LR_HPP.pkl`) makes the prediction.
4. The predicted price is displayed, along with optional visualizations.
