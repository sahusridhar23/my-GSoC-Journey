# 🧠 My GSoC Journey (June–July 2025)

Hello! This is where I’m documenting my preparation for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) as a beginner. I’m focusing on Python, Git, DSA, and Machine Learning.


## 🗓️ Weekly Plan

- [x] Week 1: Python Basics + Git  
- [x] Week 2: NumPy + ~~DSA Arrays~~  
- [x] Week 3: Pandas + ~~DSA Arrays~~  
- [x] Week 4: Mini ML + GitHub Projects  
- [x] Week 5: Streamlit + Realign DSA plan  
- [x] Week 6: Open Source Prep + arrays questions. 
- [x] Week 7: GSOC org research + focus completion   





## ✔️ Highlights So Far

- learnt python basics(variables, data types, loops, and functions)
- learnt git basits(init, add, commit, push, and branches)
- practiced python problems ,learnt basic numpy(arrays), also matplotlib and seaborn from internship classes
- learnt OOP , numpy completely(broadcasting and vectorization) , and done assignment related to it
- Week03 compensated. 
- Built a HousePricePredictor using simple linear regession model
- learnt about streamlit web framework, developed a local web application to predice house prices bassed on limited factors.
- Realigned DSA, with arrays.
- solved nearly 10 array questions in leetcode.  
- Made a overview of GSOC orgs and few other research.
